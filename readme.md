# Simple Conveyors

![preview](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/63bd1ed4-2c53-47b2-b484-10a0b4b8d5c5)


A simple conveyor belt mod for minecraft 1.21.1 fabric and neoforge. Adds a new conveyor belt item, along with conveyor belt support and chute blocks. Works with storages from all
mods. Items will be moved at about 1 stack per second. Items pile up on the conveyor belt if they can't be inserted into the target anywhere. The belts are spline-based, only the start and
end of a belt is block-based. This means that the belts can be of any shape.

## How to use:

* (Optional:)
* * Place conveyor chute at the start and end positions. These will also be automatically placed when using the belt items.
* * Place any number of conveyor support blocks to further specify the belt path.
* Use the belt item on the starting inventory block.
* Then walk to the desired target, and use the belt item there.

## Dependencies

* Architectury API
* (Fabric Only) Fabric API
