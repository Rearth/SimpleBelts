This mod adds clean, flexible conveyor belts for Minecraft 1.21.1, compatible with **both Fabric and NeoForge**. It’s designed to work seamlessly with **any item storage mod**. The mod is still in **beta**, please report any issues you find.

### 🚚 Features:

*   Adds a new **Conveyor Belt** item, plus optional **Support** and **Chute** blocks.
*   **Fully dynamic spline-based belts**: Only the start and end need to be placed on blocks. Everything in-between can curve, bend, and twist freely.
*   **Item transfer speed**: ~1 stack per second.
*   **Smart overflow handling**: If the destination is full, items visibly pile up on the belt.
*   **Shader-compatible**: Works with iris and oculus shaders.

***

## 🛠️ How to Use

1.  _(Optional)_ Place **Chute blocks** where the belt will start and end. These can also be auto-placed when using the belt item.
2.  _(Optional)_ Add **Support blocks** anywhere along the path to shape the belt's curve.
3.  Right-click the **belt item** on a starting inventory (e.g., a chest).
4.  Walk to the destination inventory and right-click it to finish the belt.

The belt path will auto-connect between the two points!
